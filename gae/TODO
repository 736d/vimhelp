* Consider splitting ProcessedFile and UnprocessedFile objects in two:
  ProcessedFileInfo and ProcessedFileData (and similarly for UnprocessedFile).
  This makes it cheaper to update things like expires in update.py, without
  having to read and write the actual data.
  - Perhaps use ancestor relationship
  - Alternatively, use projection queries
* Compress ProcessedFile data only if necessary due to size
  - Alternatively, never compress and split up
* Add download link to github: https://github.com/b4winckler/vim
  - Check whether it actually represents the same version as us
* Change to using task queues?
  - Alternatively, is it sufficient to set the "this is cron" header on the
    request to get the 10 min (instead of 1 min) timeout?
* Store the vim version directly in the db, not the whole .hgtags (~100K)
* Use async urlfetch?
* Use mapreduce?
